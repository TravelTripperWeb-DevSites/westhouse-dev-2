  "contents": "<p>Ah, the joys of spending summer in New York: the sunny strolls through Central Park, grabbing a <a href=\"https://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/blog/taste-the-rainbow/\">frozen treat</a> in every borough, and the long, fun-filled days full of outdoor adventures. But if you&rsquo;re like most locals, after a long day of exploring the town in the heat, you&rsquo;re ready to spend a few hours in a cool, air-conditioned room. Or, better yet, a swimming pool. Yes, a swimming pool!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Though most visitors expect the joys of swimming pools to be reserved to residents of the suburbs or outer boroughs, there are a handful of nearby pools that every city resident and overheated visitor are welcome to visit. Take your pick from one of the suggested watering holes below and get ready to cool down just like you did during childhood.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.centralpark.com/things-to-do/attractions/lasker-pool/\">Lasker Pool</a> in Central Park</h3>\n<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that our first recommendation is Lasker Pool in Central Park. After a scenic 24-minute cab ride from <a href=\"https://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/\">WestHouse</a>, swimmers can enjoy either the kid-friendly wading pool or the Olympic sized swimming pool. During the winter, the Lasker area serves as an ice-skating rink, but after June 27th the pool remains open from 11am through 7pm (with a one-hour closure from 3-4pm). Entry (and sunscreen) is free, just remember to bring your own towel and lock for the lockers.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/john-jay-park-and-pool/facilities/outdoor-pools/john-jay-pool\">John Jay Pool</a> on 77th and York</h3>\n<p>Want to enjoy a view with your afternoon swim? Check out the John Jay Pool on the Upper East Side. Lined with trees, this 145-foot-long city pool is a peaceful pick for an outdoor swim in the city. Visitors can also take a peek of the view of Roosevelt Island from the pedestrian bridge leading up to the park.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.mccarrenhotel.com/hotel-pool\">McCarren Pool</a> in Williamsburg</h3>\n<p>Entry to this summertime hotspot ranges from $45 to $65 per day, but with 4,800 square feet of deck space and one of the largest outdoor heated pools in the city, it will be worth your wallet. Enjoy complimentary wi-fi, private changing rooms, chic daybeds and excellent food service to complete your day of trendy poolside lounging.</p>",
