Get ready by planning an itinerary full of trips to the city&rsquo;s most in-demand spas, cafes, and shops&mdash;and don&rsquo;t forget to cap off the adventure with the <a href=\"https://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/offer/#girls-getaway\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">perfect pampering session from WestHouse</a>. Whether you and your friends prefer to spend the days lounging at the spa or trying new dishes from the city&rsquo;s up-and-coming chefs, there are plenty of ways to make sure your next girls getaway is one to remember.</p>\n<h3>Treat Yourselves to a Spa Day</h3>\n<p>Face it&ndash;there are few activities as lavish as spending the day at a spa. Splurging on a massage or facial, or simply alternating from warm relaxing waters to invigorating steams and saunas will ensure that you and your girlfriends finish the day feeling renewed and restored. To keep the experience local (and avoid a trek home after a day of luxuriating), book a service or two at the newly opened <a href=\"https://www.baccarathotels.com/spa-de-la-mer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spa de La Mer</a> on 53rd street, just an eight-minute walk from <a href=\"https://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com\">WestHouse</a>. For a modern wellness experience with options including cryotherapy, infrared saunas, and IV drips, check out <a href=\"https://cleanmarket.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Clean Market</a> on 54th street. Or, if you and your friends love healing waters, visit the dramatic <a href=\"https://beaire.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aire Ancient Baths</a> in Tribeca, known for its signature wine bath service and temple-inspired setting.</p>\n<h3>Indulge with a Great Meal (or Two)</h3>\n<p>No, you don&rsquo;t have to escape to Italy to re-enact the first part of the iconic movie Eat, Pray, Love. Take a cue from Julia Roberts&rsquo; food-loving character and indulge in New York&rsquo;s world-renowned cuisine&mdash;guilt-free. To start the day, head to Thomas Keller&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.thomaskeller.com/bouchonbakerycaf%C3%A9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bouchon Bakery</a> in Columbus Circle (just a ten-minute walk from WestHouse). Get a taste of Keller&rsquo;s Napa magic with the cafe&rsquo;s delectable selection of pastries and French-inspired breakfast plates. For lunch, grab a slice of <a href=\"https://www.pasqualejones.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pasquale Jones</a>&rsquo; impeccable wood-fired pizza (WestHouse staff recommends the littleneck clam and spicy diavola pies, in particular). And to close out your day of culinary adventures, head to <a href=\"https://thegrillnewyork.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Grill</a> for a classic New York dinner complete with oysters on the half shell and expertly grilled steaks, chops, and seafood.</p>\n<h3>Shop Til&rsquo; You Drop</h3>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, New York&rsquo;s shopping scene is bar none. To make the most of the city&rsquo;s incomparable and varied shopping scene, plan out your day according to theme. Looking for one-of-a-kind womenswear? Discover luxurious basics made with quality craftsmanship at <a href=\"https://jasonscottclothing.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jason Scott</a>, irresistible leather goods at <a href=\"https://www.cuyana.com/visit-us-nyc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cuyana</a>, or the edgy-yet feminine style at <a href=\"https://www.aninebing.com/pages/anine-bing-madison\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anine Bing</a>. Or, for enviable home and housewares, explore the playful patterns at <a href=\"https://rebeccaatwood.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rebecca Atwood</a> and the curated, original designs at <a href=\"https://rwguild.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Roman and Williams Guild</a>.</p>\n<h3>Enjoy a <a href=\"https://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/offer/#girls-getaway\">Pampering Session With WestHouse</a></h3>\n<p>Building the perfect girls trip isn&rsquo;t just about the day-to-day activities&mdash;deciding where to stay can make or break the experience. To make the most of your trip, book the girls getaway package with WestHouse. You and your girlfriends will stay in one of our stylish suites, enjoy a 3-hour makeup lesson for two from our in-room beauty partner NOMI Beauty, and savor delicious cupcakes from Magnolia Bakery. Just make sure to book the experience at least seven days in advance so we can ensure the perfect pampering session for you and each of your guests.</p>",
