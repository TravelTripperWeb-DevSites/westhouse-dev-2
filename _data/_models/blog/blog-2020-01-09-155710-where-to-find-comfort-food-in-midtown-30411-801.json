Cozy sweaters, mugs full of warm cocoa, and snow sports are among the top highlights of the season. But what about the food? With inevitably colder temperatures and the natural instinct to hibernate, why not make the most of this time of year by indulging in your favorite foods? Here are some of our go-to spots in Midtown for digging into the hearty and satisfying fare of the season.</p>\n<h3>Mac + Cheese at <a href=\"https://thesmithrestaurant.com/location/midtown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Smith</a></h3>\n<p>Comforting American cuisine takes center stage at <a href=\"https://thesmithrestaurant.com/location/midtown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Smith</a> in Midtown (located just a twenty-minute walk east from <a href=\"https://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WestHouse</a>). This casual yet classic brasserie serves year-round favorites including their chicken pot pie, jalape&ntilde;o cheddar grits, and burger royale. But our winter pick is their skillet roasted mac and cheese, whose creamy sauce and crispy golden crust never fail to warm our bellies.</p>\n<h3>Cheeseburger at <a href=\"/websites/368/environments/30411/models/blog/instances/pjclarkes.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PJ Clarke&rsquo;s</a></h3>\n<p>When it comes to selecting satisfying comfort food, a good cheeseburger is a no brainer. But the cheeseburger from PJ Clarke&rsquo;s in Midtown takes the tried-and-true goodness to a whole new level. Consistently ranked among the top burgers in New York by the city&rsquo;s acclaimed food writers and critics, PJ Clarke&rsquo;s cheeseburger is famed to have been given the nickname &ldquo;the Cadillac of burgers&rdquo; by legendary musician Nat King Cole. Head to the location on 3rd Avenue at 55th street to try it for yourself.</p>\n<h3>Buttermilk Pancakes at <a href=\"https://pershingsquare.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pershing Square Cafe</a></h3>\n<p>This modest bistro close to Grand Central Station offers a straightforward menu&mdash;but don&rsquo;t let appearances fool you. Their buttermilk pancakes (also available in whole wheat) are some of the fluffiest in town. Choose from chocolate chip, blueberry, strawberry, banana or traditional and prepare for a fantastically heartwarming breakfast.</p>\n<h3>Chicken Paitan Ramen at <a href=\"https://tottoramen.com/menu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Totto Ramen</a></h3>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why Totto owner Bobby Munekata has expanded his ramen empire to three locations over the past six years&mdash;the guy knows good ramen. Whether you head to its location in Midtown East or West, you&rsquo;re guaranteed to indulge in a savory bowl of noodles and his signature chicken broth (though their menu offers a vegetarian-friendly option, too).</p>\n<h3>Garganelli Amatriciana at <a href=\"https://www.qualityitalian.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Quality Italian</a></h3>\n<p>Though this popular steakhouse is better known for its 28-day dry-aged prime beef, their selection of handmade pasta is a surprising crowd-pleaser. You can&rsquo;t go wrong with their potato gnocchi or porterhouse agnolotti, but the Roman-style amatriciana&mdash;complete with a hearty tomato sauce and authentic guanciale&mdash;is our go-to winter dish.</p>",
