Take just a ten-minute walk from <a title=\"WestHouse\" href=\"https://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WestHouse</a> to arrive at the Hallett Nature Sanctuary and Pond by the park&rsquo;s south entrance, and gaze at the sanctuary&rsquo;s colorful variety of trees including black cherry, ginkgo, gray birch, pin oak and tupelo trees. Use Central Park&rsquo;s helpful <a title=\"Fall Foliage Map\" href=\"http://assets.centralparknyc.org/pdfs/maps/Central_Park_Fall_Foliage_Map.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fall Foliage Map</a> to guide your stroll, or sign-up for an <a title=\"official tour of the park&rsquo;s North Woods\" href=\"http://www.centralparknyc.org/events/individual-events/fall-foliage-walk-north-woods-2019-10-24.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">official tour of the park&rsquo;s North Woods</a>.
