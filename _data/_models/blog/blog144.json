Started in 1982, the market was originally launched by a group of parents who were trying to find a creative solution for raising money for their children&rsquo;s schools. Now, the Grand Bazaar is one of the oldest markets in NYC and continues to serve as a funding source for four nearby public schools. Though the market is open year-round, the late summer pop-ups are the perfect opportunity to drink, shop and peruse in the sunshine all while contributing to a worthy and local cause.
