Started in 1982, the market was originally launched by a group of parents who were trying to find a creative solution for raising money for their children&rsquo;s schools. Now, the Grand Bazaar is one of the oldest markets in NYC and continues to serve as a funding source for four nearby public schools. Though the market is open year-round, the late summer pop-ups are the perfect opportunity to drink, shop and peruse in the sunshine all while contributing to a worthy and local cause. Choose from events like the <a title=\"Shop Around the World Pop-Up\" href=\"https://grandbazaarnyc.org/events/shop-around-the-world-pop-up-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shop Around the World Pop-Up</a>, where vendors gather to sell an incredible selection of unique handmade goods from around the world, or the <a title=\"Summer Brunch &amp; Shop\" href=\"https://grandbazaarnyc.org/events/summer-brunch-shop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Summer Brunch &amp; Shop</a> event, complete with lobster rolls and a curated selection of goods from women-owned small businesses.</p>\n<h3><a title=\"Blues BBQ Festival\" href=\"https://hudsonriverpark.org/events/bluesbbq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blues BBQ Festival</a></h3>\n<p>This year, Hudson River Park&rsquo;s annual Blues BBQ Festival celebrates its 20th anniversary.
