Congratulations! Your suitcase is officially packed and ready for vacation at <a href=\"mailto:https://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/\">WestHouse Hotel</a>. But there&rsquo;s still one important bag left to pack: your carry-on. Whether you&rsquo;re hopping on a quick flight or jet setting on a longer international trip, it&rsquo;s important to stash the essentials in your carry-on bag. Here are the 10 things we can&rsquo;t live without.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>1. TRAVEL DOCUMENTS</strong></p>\n<p>Start with the basics. At the very least, you&rsquo;ll need your boarding pass and driver&rsquo;s license or ID. You might also need your passport, a copy of your flight itinerary, and a copy of any transportation or accommodation plans you&rsquo;ve made for arrival. Bonus points if you organize these travel documents in the order in which you&rsquo;ll need them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>2. LAYERS</strong></p>\n<p>Airport temperatures are unpredictable. Sometimes airplanes are freezing, and sometimes the air conditioning is broken. Dress in layers so you&rsquo;ll be comfortable no matter what. We also recommend bringing a pair of compression socks. Not only will they keep you warm when temperatures dip, but they&rsquo;ll also help reduce the risk of leg swelling and blood clots.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>3. A GOOD BOOK</strong></p>\n<p>Is there a book you&rsquo;ve been meaning to read, or a new release you&rsquo;ve been dying to dig into? A plane ride is the perfect time to start a new novel. It&rsquo;s guaranteed quiet, uninterrupted reading time when you can be alone with the page and nothing else.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>4. HEADPHONES</strong></p>\n<p>Most airlines offer headphones for a small fee, but it can&rsquo;t hurt to bring your own. Even if you plan to read or sleep, you never know &mdash; your favorite movie might be available to watch on demand.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>5. ELECTRONICS CHARGERS</strong></p>\n<p>Like we said, travel can be unpredictable. You may have a fully charged phone or tablet battery at the start of your journey, but there&rsquo;s no telling how much you&rsquo;ll use it throughout the day, especially when you&rsquo;re in transit. Always pack chargers for your electronics in your carry-on, not your checked bag.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>6. EYE MASK</strong></p>\n<p>Some travelers prefer to sleep on the plane, especially during long international flights. But many struggle to actually fall asleep. An eye mask can work wonders for blocking out distractions so you can get some serious shut-eye.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>7. HAND SANITIZER</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, airports and airplanes have many surfaces that can breed bacteria. It&rsquo;s important to do your best to steer clear of germs, and using hand sanitizer can help keep bacteria at bay. You don&rsquo;t want to catch a cold before your well-deserved holiday starts!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>8. FACIAL WIPES</strong></p>\n<p>Planes don&rsquo;t afford the luxury of a full bathroom, but you can still stay fresh without your full arsenal of products. Facial wipes eliminate oil and soothe skin after a long day of travel. In a pinch, they can double as surface cleaning wipes too.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>9. VITAMIN + ELECTROLYTES PACKET</strong></p>\n<p>Another way to avoid catching a cold is to fight germs before they can get to you. Head them off at the pass with an Emergen-C packet or an Airborne tablet. These supplements contain vitamins, electrolytes, antioxidants, and other ingredients that will help prevent colds and improve your immune system functions. Just mix one with your water and you&rsquo;re good to go before the plane even takes off.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>10. A SNACK</strong></p>\n<p>You never know when you might get hungry for a snack, especially if you have special dietary needs that airplanes might not accommodate. After a busy day of travel, a little bite of something sweet or savory can go a long way.</p>"
