But when it comes to Thanksgiving, it&rsquo;s first and foremost all about the food.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve decided to take a break from the kitchen this holiday, you&rsquo;re in luck. With world-renowned chefs around every corner, New York City is the perfect destination for Thanksgiving travel that doesn&rsquo;t fall short on flavor. Here&rsquo;s a roundup of our favorite nearby restaurants offering holiday menus this year.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.oceanarestaurant.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Oceana</a></h3>\n<p>Seafood lovers will fit right in at Oceana, a fish-focused restaurant led by executive chef Bill Telepan that highlights sustainable, seasonal ingredients and is located just a ten-minute walk from WestHouse&rsquo;s front steps. This year, Telepan and his crew will prepare a three-course prix-fixe menu for the holiday, priced at $88 per person and $50 for children under twelve. The menu is perfectly suited to satisfy a group with varied taste buds. Traditionalists can have their roasted organic turkey will all of the trimmings, while more ambitious diners can choose from a festive menu of heritage pork chop, kuri squash gnocchi or seared halibut. Plus, Thanksgiving guests can top off their holiday meals with a selection of items from Oceana&rsquo;s famed raw bar.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.cafeboulud.com/nyc/menus/#thanksgiving\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Caf&eacute; Boulud</a></h3>\n<p>Fans of the Michelin-starred restaurateur Daniel Boulud can reserve their holiday feasts at Caf&eacute; Boulud, located just a fifteen-minute cab ride away from WestHouse. Inspired by Boulud&rsquo;s family roots in Lyon, this fine-dining destination is known for its warm hospitality and impeccable French-American cuisine. This holiday, their three-course menu options (offered at $175 per person) include salmon gravlax, foie gras terrine and pumpkin soup to start, and free range turkey, beef striploin and striped bass &ldquo;en paupiette&rdquo; for the main course. Children under twelve can join the party with a two-course meal at $55, and all guests can select from their options of sides and classic desserts to finish.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://victorscafe.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Victor&rsquo;s Cafe</a></h3>\n<p>Want to add a bit of live music into your celebration this year? Then make sure to book a table at Victor&rsquo;s Cafe, just a five-minute walk from WestHouse. A Midtown staple for over fifty years, Victor&rsquo;s is one of the area&rsquo;s go-to destinations for Cuban food, music and charm. Their $36 Thanksgiving menu includes roasted turkey with cornbread and chorizo stuffing, sweet potato mash, cranberry sauce&mdash;and like any good Caribbean meal&mdash;white rice and black beans. The menu price doesn&rsquo;t include beverages, but don&rsquo;t let that stop you from adding a mojito or cuba libre into the mix.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.8thhillnyc.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">8th Hill</a></h3>\n<p>While many beloved restaurants are offering holiday menus this Thanksgiving, very few can offer dinner and a show. Mediterreanean powerhouse 8th Hill, located a ten-minute cab ride away from WestHouse, capitalizes on its picture-perfect location to offer diners a ringside seat to the passing Thanksgiving Day parade. At 8th Hill, you can indulge in your Mediterrean-inspired Thanksgiving meal as the parade&rsquo;s floats, balloons and dancers pass just a block away.</p>",
