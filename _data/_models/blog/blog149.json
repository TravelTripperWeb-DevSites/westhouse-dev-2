Regardless of how you feel about <a href=\"https://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/blog/pumpkin-spice-and-everything-nice/\">pumpkin spice</a> lattes, sweater-weather season has some undeniable pros: heart-warming food, colorful foliage and themed outdoor activities. Whether your idea of that perfect fall moment involves foraging for fruit at a farm upstate, or getting cozy by a wood-burning fire, here are a few options for getting your fill of the season.</p>\n<h3>Pick-Your-Own Apples at <a href=\"https://appleridgeorchards.com\">Apple Ridge Orchards</a></h3>\n<p>Didn&rsquo;t get your fill of apple picking in October? You&rsquo;re in luck! Apple Ridge Orchards welcomes visitors from Thursday through Sunday through early November. Choose to pick-your-own apples or pick-your-own pumpkins while at the orchard, but we recommend calling them in advance to check-in on their crop supply and expected weather during your travel date. To get there, board the 196 or 197 bus at the Port Authority Bus Terminal (just a fifteen-minute walk from WestHouse). Plan to get off at the Warwick Park &amp; Ride station, and take a taxi for the remaining 4.5 miles to the orchard. Each way, the journey should take about two hours, leaving you plenty of time to enjoy the apples (or apple cider doughnuts) you acquired during the trip.</p>\n<h3>Grab a Forkful at <a href=\"https://www.littlepiecompany.com/\">Little Pie Company</a></h3>\n<p>Everyone knows that the holidays are the time to indulge, right? Truth is, few seasonal delicacies are as treasured as the homemade pumpkin pie. And at Little Pie Company, you can rest assured that your craving will be satisfied with all of the love and attention to detail as if it was baked by your favorite grandma. Choose from their crowd-pleasing pumpkin pie or another seasonal favorite, like their sour cream apple walnut pie. But be warned, at just a twenty-minute walk away from WestHouse, you may find yourself returning for an extra slice sooner than expected.</p>\n<p><img id=\"1572885846562\" class=\" \" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1572884942/mlelhpucb0tz2jwokjqi.jpg\" alt=\"beer-unsplash\" data-image-large=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1572884942/mlelhpucb0tz2jwokjqi.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_992,w_992/v1572884942/mlelhpucb0tz2jwokjqi.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_768,w_768/v1572884942/mlelhpucb0tz2jwokjqi.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_300,w_300/v1572884942/mlelhpucb0tz2jwokjqi.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,h_140,w_140/v1572884942/mlelhpucb0tz2jwokjqi.jpg\" /></p>\n<h3>Sip a Pint at <a href=\"https://ciderweeknyc.com/nyc/\">Cider Week</a></h3>\n<p>Get your fill of locally crafted cider during this year&rsquo;s cider week, taking place in NYC from November 8th through the 17th.
